- graph service index files with fts on fs change event
- load a file into editor
- save a file
- pull changes
- Idea: tree-sitter with markdown parser
- Idea: use filesystem for version management, ala real editor
  - e.g. Once a file is tracking a remote, editing it creates a backup copy
  - 'file.md' -edit-> 'file.md (edited)' + 'file.md~' -commit-> 'file.md'
