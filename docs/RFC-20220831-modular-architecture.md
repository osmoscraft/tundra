- Core
  - What: frames content
  - Least powerful language (plaintext), highly portable
  - Emit events on all mutations
  - Passive (avoid self-mutation). All mutations are imperatively driven by modules
- Modules
  - Have access to standard APIs
    - Networking
    - Remote module loading
    - Inter-module communication
    - Module storage
    - Pakcage update management
  - Operate on the frames, create meaningful user applications
  - End-to-end isolates for highest modularity
