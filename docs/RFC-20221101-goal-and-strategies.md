# Goals and Strategies

- Descending priority
  - Push myself to learn great things with the limited time, attention, and energy in life.
    - Be experimental first, and converge to stable solution with emperical learning from using the tool. (Self-bootstrap)
  - Make a very low, if not zero, cost solution so anyone can replicate the idea.
    - Make it open-source and self-hostable.
    - Self-hosting viability
    - Limited consumption of external service
  - Make it durable over decades if not a life-time.
    - Build with the open-source community
    - Reduce dependency
    - Built on mature, stable platforms
    - Dependent on technologies with redundancy
