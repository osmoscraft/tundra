# How to communicate between UI thread and background thread

## Findings

- `SharedWorker` port messaging with `SharedWorker` is the fastest
  - Open ports cannot be tracked for broadcasting, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13662089/
- Dedicated `Worker` messaging is slower
- `BroadcastChannel` messaging is the slowest
- Local WebRTC is not measured

## Decision

- Use `SharedWorker` port messaging for REST request
- Use `BroadcastChannel` for server push
- Build abstraction layer on top of `SharedWorker` and `BroadcastChannel` to enable subscription
  - Initial response will use `SharedWorker` port messaging
  - Sub-sequent updates will use `BroadcastChannel`
