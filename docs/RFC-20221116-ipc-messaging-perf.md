- Script JIT injection + RPC vs. Script pre-install + messaging
  - JIT increase message 20ms latency
- Pre-execution and store in background vs. Script pre-install + messaging
  - Background thread communication still increase 10ms latency after saving 10ms by pre-execution
  - If execution is longer than 20ms, Background pre-execution will become better solution
- Untested: Communicate with persistent port
